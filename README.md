# EDA-Case-Study
Introduction
This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. 
In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in 
banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.     
Business Understanding 
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. 
Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending 
various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of 
repaying the loan are not rejected.
